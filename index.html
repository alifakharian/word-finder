It was invented by the English scientist Tim Berners-Lee in 1989. He wrote the first web browser computer program in 1990. The World Wide Web has been central to the development of the Information Age and is the primary tool billions of people use to interact on the Internet.

Website content can largely be provided by the publisher or by users who contribute content online.
